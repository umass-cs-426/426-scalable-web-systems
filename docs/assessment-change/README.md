# Assessment Change

**Spring Semester 2025 (03-31-2025):**

Students expressed that they were unhappy with the amount of workload for a 3-credit course. I proposed 4 different alternatives and asked for their input. Here are the different options I proposed:

## Original Proposals

**Proposal 1**: No changes to the course structure.

**Proposal 2-NA:**

- Discontinue attendance and sprint reports.
- Continue with manageable homework, projects, and in-class exercises.

Proposal 2-A:**

- Maintain attendance.
- Discontinue sprint reports.
- Continue with manageable homework, projects, and in-class exercises.

**Proposal 3-NA:**

- Discontinue attendance, sprint reports, and homework.
- Continue only with projects and in-class exercises.

**Proposal 3-A:**

- Maintain attendance.
- Discontinue sprint reports and homework.
- Continue only with projects and in-class exercises.

## Assessment Adjustment

**Current Breakdown of Grades:**

- 10% Attendance
- 20% Homework
- 20% Sprints
- 50% 1 Project with 5 Milestones

## Poll Proposals

I have removed homework and sprints as a base starting point. Sprints are to much of a burden on a weekly basis. They are useful in practice, but difficult as designed in this course. Homework requires careful design and connection as well as the ability to score them in a reasonable (and likely automated) way. This is not feasible for the instructor to implement in short notice. The emphasis will be placed on designing DIY and Lesson Practice exercises. The instructor believes in smaller more focused problems to solve. These exercises will be created to focus the class meeting and lectures as well as provide a direct connection to the exercises.

Please review the following:

- An updated version of the assessments.
- Each proposal and the assessment categories and weights.

**Assessment Changes/Adjustments:**

- Attendance: If included in a proposal, attendance will be counted. We may migrate towards a more streamlined attendance implementation. Because of the lesson practice exercises we simply count those as attendance for synchronous students who submit within an hour after class (to give a little extra time). For asynchronous students, the submission would simply count towards attendance. We can iron out the details if there are any issues with this.
- DIY Exercises: Exercises to be completed individually by students based on the material covered in the preparatory material provided. Submissions will be individual. Grading will be based on the quality of your submission, not on a correct solution.
- Lesson Practice Exercises: Exercises to be completed in a group in-class or on zoom. Groups can be chosen by students. Zoom rooms will be available for students to gather if they would like. Asynchronous students can either work collaboratively with another student or individually. Submissions will be individual. Grading will be based on the quality of your submission, not on a correct solution.
- Milestones: The milestones will no longer be submitted as a team. You will work as a team on the project, but the milestones will be individual. They will be a simplified combination of both a sprint report and a milestone. They will be more of a reflection of your own learning and an opportunity to share an example of something you did that you are particularly proud of. You will need to provide an example of a single Issue you worked on, a single PR you pushed through, a single commit that demonstrates your work, and a single comment on a team members issue or PR. Milestones will be submitted every 3 weeks. You will submit a single short markdown file in a template we provide. Grading will be based on the completed submission, the quality of your submission, but not on a correct solution.
- Project Submission: The project itself will be submitted individually at the conclusion of the course. This will be a self-report of the work that you accomplished in the project. It will include an account of all the work you did on the project using your Git repository as evidence (Issues, PRs, Commits, Comments). It will include a reflection of what you learned in the course and how this material will impact your life and career moving forward. You will submit a single markdown file in a template we provide. Grading will be based on the completed submission, the quality of your submission, and a solid assessment of your own work in this course. There is no correct solution - only convincing arguments.
