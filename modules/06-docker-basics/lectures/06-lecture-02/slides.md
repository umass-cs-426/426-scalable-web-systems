# Basic Docker Container Commands

We have investigated several examples of using Docker at this point. Let go over
some of these commands and provide a little more detail and some examples.

We'll review the following:

- `docker run`
- `docker ps`
- `docker stop`
- `docker rm`

---

## `docker run`

**Format:**

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

**Description:**
Creates and starts a new container from the given image. Running this command
will print the ID of the container to the terminal:

```bash
‚ùØ docker run -d --name web-front -p 8080:80 nginx
9e23ab966dd3bd8456d949329398975ead2cb5cb3bbae250b08acf036ab0d445
```

The container ID is important for other commands to designate actions to be
performed on specific containers.

**Use Case:**
Run an image like `hello-world` to verify that Docker is installed correctly.

---

## `docker ps`

**Format:**

```bash
docker ps [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**

```bash
‚ùØ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS                          NAMES
a21476a4486f   nginx         "/docker-entrypoint.‚Ä¶"   3 seconds ago        Up 2 seconds                    80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8081->81/tcp   web-front2
94a68639c63a   hello-world   "/hello"                 About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                                  awesome_cerf
9e23ab966dd3   nginx         "/docker-entrypoint.‚Ä¶"   6 minutes ago        Up 6 minutes                    0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp           web-front
```

As you can see above, there are three different containers shown in the output
above. Two of them are running and the other has exited. But, the container
that exited still exists. We need to use another command to clean up if we
want to do that.

**Description:**
Lists running containers. Use `-a` to show all containers including stopped ones.

**Use Case:**
See which containers are currently running or have recently run.

---

## `docker logs`

**Format:**

```bash
docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
```

**Example:**

Dumps logs to standard output:
```bash
docker logs web-front
```

Follow the container‚Äôs logs in real-time (like tail -f), great for live
debugging or development:
```bash
docker logs -f web-front
```

**Description:**
Fetches and displays the stdout/stderr logs from a container. Use options like 
`--tail` and `-f` to control output.

**Use Case:**
Debug a containerized application by viewing its output, errors, and status 
messages.

---

## `docker stop`

**Format:**

```bash
docker stop CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker stop my_container
```

**Description:**
Gracefully stops a running container.

**Use Case:**
Stop a container before deleting or restarting it.

---

## `docker rm`

**Format:**

```bash
docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker rm my_container
```

**Description:**
Removes one or more containers.

**Use Case:**
Clean up containers you no longer need.

---

# Example: NGINX Web Server

## üî• Step 1: Run a Scalable Web Server

<br>
```bash
docker run -d --name web-front -p 8080:80 nginx
```

**What it does:**
- Runs `nginx` in **detached** mode (`-d`)
- Names the container `web-front`
- Maps your local port 8080 to container port 80

üß† **Use Case:** 
Start a reverse proxy or web front-end in a microservices setup.

---

## üîç Step 2: Check Running Containers

<br>
```bash
docker ps
```

**What you'll see:**
- Container `web-front`
- Status: Up
- Port: 0.0.0.0:8080 ‚Üí 80/tcp

üß† **Use Case:** 
Confirm it‚Äôs running and check ports/status.

---

## üõë Step 3: Stop the Container

<br>
```bash
docker stop web-front
```

**What it does:**
- Gracefully stops the nginx container

üß† **Use Case:** 
Temporarily shut down the service without losing data (unless it's ephemeral).

---

## üßπ Step 4: Remove the Container

<br>
```bash
docker rm web-front
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes the stopped container from your system

üß† **Use Case:** 
Clean up resources after testing or deployment.

---

# Running Containers

## Interactive vs Detached Mode

---

## `-it` (Interactive Mode)

**Format:**

```bash
docker run -it IMAGE [COMMAND]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

**Description:**
Runs a container with interactive terminal support.

**Use Case:**
Useful for debugging, trying out commands inside the container.

---

## `-d` (Detached Mode)

**Format:**

```bash
docker run -d IMAGE [COMMAND]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker run -d nginx
```

**Description:**
Runs a container in the background.

**Use Case:**
Start a long-running service like a web server.

---

# Accessing Running Containers

---

## `docker exec`

**Format:**

```bash
docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker exec -it my_container bash
```

**Description:**
Run a command inside a running container.

**Use Case:**
Get a shell inside a running container.

---

## `docker attach`

**Format:**

```bash
docker attach [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
```

**Example:**

# Microservice Architecture

Remember this architecture we <br>
investigated previously?

::left::

<div style="margin: 10px 150px 10px -10px">

Microservices are a good way to help application scale. However,
the deployment of such applications must also scale.

We can use Docker to *containerize* each service into a separately
running container. This will allow us to easily deploy and scale
parts of the application independently.

It will also allow us to easily "wire up" our services to make it
easier to develop and introduce new services.

# Containers vs Images

- At this point we have explored Docker by running containers from existing
images. Just this alone demonstrates how useful Docker is from a standpoint
of running complex applications without installing them.

- But, we want to do more than that. We want to be able to create images for
our own applications and run them in containers.

# Docker Images

How do you create a Docker image?

::left::

<div style="margin-top: -140px; margin-right: 20px;">

You create a Docker image by writing a **Dockerfile**, a text file that defines:

- The **base image** to start from (e.g., `node`, `python`, `alpine`)
- The **commands to run** (e.g., install packages, copy files)
- The **default behavior** when the container starts

</div>

::right::

<div style="margin-top: -130px; margin-left: 20px;">

Then, you build the image using:

```bash
docker build -t my-image-name .
```

*This packages everything into a reusable, shareable image ‚Äî the foundation for running scalable services.*

# Docker Images

What are the different parts of the `docker-build` command?

````md magic-move
```bash
docker build -t my-image-name .
```
```bash
docker build
# `docker build` tells Docker to build an image
```
```bash
docker build -t my-image-name
# `-t my-image-name` tags the image with a name 
# so you can reference it easily
```
```bash
docker build -t my-image-name .
# `.` (dot) specifies the "build context". This
# is usually the directory containing you Dockerfile
# and application source code
```

An overview of a basic Dockerfile.

```dockerfile {all|1,2|4,5|7,8|10,11|13,14|16,17|19,20|all}{lines: true}
# 1. Base image
FROM node:20-alpine

# 2. Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy dependency files
COPY package*.json ./

# 4. Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# 5. Copy source code
COPY . .

To enable **live reload from host changes**, mount the project directory:

**MacOS/Linux:**

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app express-dev-tsx
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app express-dev-tsx

**Windows cmd.exe:**

```cmd
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v %cd%:/app express-dev-tsx

# Two Services

- The next interesting thing we want to do is to figure out
how to have two services talk to one another.
- If we can do that, then we can start building a microservice
architecture like the one we saw at the beginning.

Visit the service directories in two terminals:

```bash
cd service-b # terminal 1
cd service-a # terminal 2
```

Run the following in terminal 1:

```bash
docker build -t service-b .
docker run -d --name api-b --network demo-net service-b
```

Run the following in terminal 2:

# Back to The Microservice Architecture

Dockerizing an entire system

We need to "dockerize" the following services:

- registry
- api-gateway
- service-a
- service-b
- service-c
- service-d

**This means:**
- They all need a `Dockerfile`
- They all need to be on the same network
